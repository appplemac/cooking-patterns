### Vinaigrette

Vinaigrette is a cold sauce composed of 60% of oils, 30% of acids and 10% of other flavors.
This sauce is often used to season salads, raw vegetables and sometimes raw fruits.

### Preparation steps
1. In a container, place 60% of oil (e.g. Olive Oil, Grape seed oil, Sesame oil, Nut oil, Avocado oil).
2. Add 30% of acids and beat the sauce. The most common version is to use Vinegar (e.g. red wine, balsamic, sherry, rice) but Lemon Juice works too.
3. Add 10% of one to three additionnal flavors (e.g. Mustard, Jam, Parsley, Basil, Garlic, Shallots, Ginger, Soy sauce, Tahini) and beat the sauce.
4. Add Black Salt and Pepper then taste and adjust the seasonings.
5. [Optional] Sweet variation: if your vinaigrette is sour tasting you can add sugar or honey to sweeten the taste.
6. Beat the sauce before serving.
